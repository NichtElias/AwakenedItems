# Awakened Items

[Awakened Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/awakened-items) is a mod for Minecraft introducing items that talk to the player and get stronger as they are used.

## Features

- Awaken any item. Absolutely any item.
- Awakened items will get better the more you use them (similar to Tinkers Tool Leveling). This currently only has an effect for melee weapons, block breaking tools and armor.
- Each awakened item talks to you and has a personality.

## Miscellaneous Abilities of Awakened Items

- They talk to you. Sometimes they even warn you of approaching mobs.
- They don't like being picked up by mobs and will defend themselves.
- They're loyal to their owner and won't work as well for other players.
- They don't despawn. They may get lonely though.

## Supported Items

As stated above, all items can be awakened. If you can drop it you can awaken it. That sadly doesn't mean all items will benefit from awakening.
They will all talk, but the leveling and becoming stronger only works if the item in question fulfills certain criteria.

Generally the following items should work just as you'd expect:

- Melee weapons (swords, maces, axes, etc.)
- Tools used for breaking blocks (pickaxes, axes, hoes, etc.)
- Armor
- Bows
- Tridents as melee weapons (they don't do more damage when thrown)

## Roadmap

In arbitrary order.

- trident support
- support for other item types
- soulstuff recipe changing depending on what other mods are present
- more personalities
- more situations in which the items talk
- item messages dependent on item type
- more interesting item awakening
- milestone levels that have special requirements
